              <h3>Web Development</h3>
              <p>
                Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site
                for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
                network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple
                single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet
                applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social
                network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which
                Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering,
                Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network
                security configuration, and e-commerce development.

              <h3>Product Design</h3>
              <p>
                The design of a product is essential to the function, aesthetic
                appeal, and market value. Therefore, a product design company
                such as codeacademy js-1 considers all the necessary details
                related to manufacturing from the very first stage of
                development to avoid production roadblocks, problems, or delays.
                Our product design company goes beyond the highly technical
                aspects of engineering by implementing functional and innovative
                solutions that look good, feel right, and deliver the best
                quality.

              <h3>Mobile Applications</h3>
              <p>
                A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply
                an app, is a computer program or software application designed
                to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch.
                Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such
                as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand
                for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile
                games, factory automation, GPS and location-based services,
                order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now
                millions of apps available. Apps are generally downloaded from
                application distribution platforms which are operated by the
                owner of the mobile operating system, such as the App Store
                (iOS) or Google Play Store. Some apps are free, and others have
                a price, with the profit being split between the application's
                creator and the distribution platform. Mobile applications often
                stand in contrast to desktop applications which are designed to
                run on desktop computers, and web applications which run in
                mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile device.

              <h3>Enterprise Solutions</h3>
              <p>
                What is Enterprise Solutions Development? Enterprise development
                is a collaborative environment where IT works to build
                applications that align with the internal business team as well
                as customers. The agile system of apps is highly driven by a
                better understanding of users' challenges and addressing those
                requirements with a solution. Not only this, but the teams also
                anticipate customers' future needs and embrace technological
                advancements. That makes it vital for the enterprises to evolve
                at a rapid pace for adapting in the dynamically changing digital
                landscape. As a leading provider of enterprise solutions,

              <h3>QA Testing</h3>
              <p>
                When you buy a pear, you can instantly evaluate its quality: the
                size and shape, ripeness, the absence of visible bruising. But
                only as you take the first bite, will you be able to see if the
                pear is really that good. Even an extremely good-looking pear
                might taste sour or have a worm in it. The same applies to
                almost any product, be it a physical object or a piece of
                software. A website you find on the Internet might seem fine at
                first, but as you scroll down, go to another page, or try to
                send a contact request, it can start showing some design flaws
                and errors. This makes quality control so important in every
                field, where an end-user product is created. Yet, a sour pear
                won’t cause as much damage as a self-driving car with poor
                quality autopilot software. A single error in an EHR system
                might put a patient’s life at risk, while an eCommerce website
                that has performance issues might cost the owner millions of
                dollars in revenue. That is why we at AltexSoft put a premium on
                the quality of software we build for our clients. In this paper,
                we will share our insights on the quality assurance and testing
                process, our best practices and preferred strategies.
